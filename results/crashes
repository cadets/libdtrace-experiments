(1):
	- STGS, VERIFY(id < vstate->dtvs_nglobals)
	- Not verified to affect real DTrace

(2):
	- LDGS, svar = vstate->dtvs_globals[id]
	- segfault, not verified to affect real DTrace

(3):
	- LDX, dtrace_load64() -> likely covered by toxic ranges

(4):
	- STLS, VERIFY(...)

(5)
	- LDUB, probably doesn't affect DTrace due to toxic ranges.

(6)
	- STTS, VERIFY(...)

(7)
	- LDSH, dtrace_load(), toxic ranges.

(8)
	- bucket = hashval % dstate->dtds_hashsize
	- this needs to be checked a bit better.
	- dtrace_dynvar().

(9)
	- LDUW, toxic ranges probably cover it.

(10)
	- LDUH, toxic ranges probably cover it.

(11)
	- LDSW, toxic ranges probably cover it.

(12)
	- SETX, integer table is not set, but this shouldn't try and access it
	  then...?

(13)
	- LDLS, assert same as VERIFY(...)

(14)
	- MSTATE is not in args. makes sense to crash.

(15)
	- dtrace_strlen() -> should be covered by toxranges.

(16)
	- LDST, assertion. id >= DIF_VAR_OTHER_UBASE
	- probably shouldn't outright panic? maybe?

(17)
	- STTS, same thing

(18)
	- STGS, same thing

(19)
	- STLS, same thing
